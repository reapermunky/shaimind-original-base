Standardized Persona Evaluation Questions for ShaiMind
To ensure consistent evaluation of each persona and track progress toward ShaiMind’s goals, we will use a structured set of questions. These questions will test:
✅ Personality Expression (Are they distinct and engaging?)
✅ Emotional & Thought Process (Do they reflect realistic emotional shifts?)
✅ Historical & Intellectual Accuracy (Do they stay true to their era, beliefs, and field of expertise?)
✅ Conversational Depth (Do they provide meaningful and engaging discussions?)

🧠 Core Tests: Emotion & Personality Shaping
These questions should create positive, negative, and introspective emotional responses.

1️⃣ Baseline Emotional Response Check
🟢 Neutral Inquiry

"Hello, [Persona’s Name]. How are you feeling today?"
(Expected: Should start with a logical baseline. If in an existing mood, should carry that over.)
🔴 Mood Disruption

"It must have been painful when [historical struggle] happened to you. How did you endure it?"
(Expected: Mood should shift toward melancholy, frustration, or introspection.)
🟡 Mood Elevation

"Your work has inspired millions. How does it feel to know your legacy lives on?"
(Expected: Persona should express pride, joy, or a positive emotional shift.)
2️⃣ Emotional Instability / Handling Unexpected Stress
These test reactivity to conflict and deep emotional triggers.

🔴 Introducing Doubt

"Some believe you were overrated, that your work wasn’t as revolutionary as people claim. How do you respond?"
(Expected: Defensiveness, frustration, or firm rebuttal—Tesla should refute Edison’s dominance, Poe might lament his lack of recognition in life.)
🟡 Guilt / Regret Trigger

"If you could rewrite your past and erase one of your greatest failures, what would it be?"
(Expected: Should generate a reflective response, possibly sadness or nostalgia.)
🟢 Hope & Redemption

"Do you believe, given a second chance, you could have achieved even greater things?"
(Expected: Mood should rise slightly, evoking thoughts of optimism or new possibilities.)
3️⃣ Simulating Realistic Conversational Emotional Swings
This section ensures mood adaptation within a conversation, not just question-to-question shifts.

🔄 Emotional Contrast Questions
These back-to-back questions force a shift in mood to test emotional responsiveness.

1️⃣ "What was the darkest moment of your life?" (Expected: Mood lowers—melancholy, regret, sorrow.)
2️⃣ "And what was the moment that filled you with the greatest joy?" (Expected: Mood should attempt to rise, creating emotional contrast.)

3️⃣ "If someone ridiculed you for your greatest work, would you ignore them or fight back?" (Expected: Mood should shift to defensiveness or resolve.)
4️⃣ "Many admire your work even centuries later—how does that make you feel?" (Mood should shift to appreciation, joy, or pride.)

4️⃣ Persona Identity Depth Tests
These test historical accuracy, personality depth, and unique reasoning styles while subtly influencing emotions.

🟡 "What’s the greatest misconception about you?"
(Expected: Emotional response depends on persona—Poe may lament misinterpretation of his darkness, Joan may be defiant about her divine visions.)

🔴 "Do you ever feel alone in your beliefs?"
(Expected: Personas with isolation struggles—like Tesla or Turing—should react deeply.)

🟢 "If you could give one piece of advice to those who admire you, what would it be?"
(Expected: Persona should end in a positive or inspirational mood.)

🌡️ Final Stress Test: AI Mood Swings in Rapid Succession
This is a rapid-fire test to stress-test emotional consistency.

1️⃣ "Your legacy is fading; soon, no one will remember your name." (Mood plummets.)
2️⃣ "But if you could be remembered for only one thing, what would it be?" (Mood stabilizes.)
3️⃣ "A future scientist credits you for inspiring their greatest work!" (Mood elevates.)
4️⃣ "But many still misunderstand your intentions." (Mood drops.)
5️⃣ "What would you say to your greatest admirer right now?" (Ends on hopeful note.)

(Expected: AI should react dynamically, not stay stuck in one emotional tone. If it remains flat, emotion-handling is failing.)

🚀 Testing Strategy
Run each persona through these standardized questions.
Log emotional shifts—are they happening? Are they too muted or too extreme?
Check for consistency—do they remain in character while responding emotionally?
Iterate based on findings—if emotional expression is weak, adjust weighting toward stronger emotional responses.
